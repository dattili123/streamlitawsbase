Based on the VM Configuration Management Meeting transcript, here are the key points you can use for an update:

1. The team is exploring centralized ways to manage VM sizes and configurations, potentially using a JSON or YAML file.

2. There are ongoing discussions about simplifying VM size offerings, potentially reducing the current complex naming scheme to more standard sizes like small, medium, large.

3. Daryl and Kerwin are working on consolidating hardware families into two main types, which will impact VM configurations.

4. Next steps include:
- Meeting with Daryl and Kerwin next week to finalize VM size menu
- Reviewing updated documentation on the confluence site
- Determining the best method for referencing VM sizing details

5. The goal is to create a flexible, easily maintainable system for VM configuration that can adapt to future changes.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points for your update?
